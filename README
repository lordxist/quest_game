QuestGame
=========

Lightweight Rails Plugin for quest-/turn-based games. Currently highly experimental, enjoy with care.

Generator
=========

The 'quest' generator provides a way to create a quest selection controller and view, along with a 'show' view showing the player whose turn it is. The first argument is the quest model name, the second argument the player model name (by default 'player').

Configuration
=============

You can configure the turn duration of each player and the earliest time (before the start) that a player can join a quest.

Example:

Quest.create(
  :starts_at => "2010-04-04 20:00:00",
  :turn_duration => 30,                # default: 60
  :quest_join_time => 600              # default: 300
)
